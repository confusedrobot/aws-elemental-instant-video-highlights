# catfinder5003 "Automated Transcribe and Translate"

This is an evolution of the OG catfinder5001 that includes the ability to extend analysis from visual ( Amazon Rekognition ) to audible ( Amazon Translate ). The transcription of the livestream is then thrown through Amazon Translate and Amazon Comprehend and displayed in a nifty webpage interface. One could easily append an automation with these results, and that part is up to you!

### catfinder5003-transcribe

The "Transcribe" Lambda function uses the WAV files created by the "Parse" Lambda function to concat them into a 1 minute audio archive. These 1 minute WAV file is then passed to Amazon Transcribe and the results are placed in the DynamoDB database. These results are also passed to Amazon Translate and Amazon Comprehend.
